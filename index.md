## How to add Links of files to Your Github Repository:

Check [my repository](https://github.com/BU-IE-360/spring22-ilaydacelenkk) to see the folder names and the uploaded files. If you click on "[Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BU-IE-360/spring22-ilaydacelenkk/gh-pages/index.md)" button on my index.md page, you can see all of codes for this page. 

Please check the links by clicking on them. 

### Correct linking of .html and .pdf files:

* [Correct Example 1](https://bu-ie-360.github.io/spring22-ilaydacelenkk/IE360_PS1_1-3-22.html): The .html file is in the same location with your index file.
* [Correct Example 2](https://bu-ie-360.github.io/spring22-ilaydacelenkk/files/IE360_PS1_1-3-22.html): The .html file is in a folder called files and this folder is in the same location with your index file.

* [Correct Example 3](IE360_PS1_1-3-22.html): You can use the path and the file name only.

* [Correct Example 4](files/IE360_PS1_1-3-22.html): You can use the path and the file name only.

* [Wrong Example](https://github.com/BU-IE-360/spring22-ilaydacelenkk/blob/gh-pages/IE360_PS1_1-3-22.html): Do not give the links with "blob" or "gh-pages". If you go to this link you **will not see** your homework report.
